run_analysis.R performs the 5 questions in the course instructions

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
X - merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y - merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subject - merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
merged - merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
mean_sd_data - selecting only columns subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement from merged.

3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Code column of the mean_sd_data replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
Code column in mean_sd_data renamed into activities
Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
Columns starting with character f replaced by Frequency
Columns starting with character t replaced by Time

5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Final is created by grouping by subject and activity followed by summarizing mean_sd_data taking the means of each variable.
